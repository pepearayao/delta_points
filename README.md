# Delta Points Project

In this project I'm looking to reverse Engineer the Delta website to retrieve de delta points of a specific user. 

I'll divide this task in steps:

1. Install all dependencies I think are neededto make this work.
3. Simulate the login process.
4. Grab the points. 
5. Store
6. Dockerize 

It is important to mention that given the little time I destined to this task, I will not be reverse engineering the API. That would take much more time than what I have left. 

## Dependencies

As I don't have much time to build this task, I will go with the easiest way to solve this problem by using SeleniumBase. This library I have used extensivly and solve much of the problems related to bot detection and captcha 
skipping. 

Besides, it it MIT licensed so we don't have to deal with IP problems or open sourcing out code base and give leverage to competitors.
